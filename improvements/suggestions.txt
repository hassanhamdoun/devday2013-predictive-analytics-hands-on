Feedback and improvement ideas from the session on Thursday 26.9.

* Histograms
  - In the presentation: motivate them better
  - Perhaps one additional slide: "Know your data and problem" before insights slide.

* Improvements to presentation
  - Differents tasks/phases in the real world problem
  - Examples of real use cases

* Add target audience in the beginning of the README.md and dev day page. 
  - The first draft added by jarkko.

* Keynote -> pdf (both)

* Update figure: x^Tw -> x^Tw = 0

* Re-think whether data should be manipulated such that claseses could not 
  be separated that well
  - add noise or data points near the p=0.5 surface?

* Make the end of the second part more functional, i.e.
  a plotting of the nonlinear decision boundary should be impelented as 
  a function -> would be easier to use
