Feedback and improvement ideas from the session on Thursday 26.9.

* Add target audience in the beginning of the README.md and dev day page. 
  - The first draft added by jarkko.
  - Review and send to forward to be added to teh web page if/when OK.

* Keynote -> pdf (both)

* Re-think whether data should be manipulated such that claseses could not 
  be separated that well
  - add noise or data points near the p=0.5 surface?

* Make the end of the second part more functional, i.e.
  a plotting of the nonlinear decision boundary should be impelented as 
  a function -> would be easier to use
